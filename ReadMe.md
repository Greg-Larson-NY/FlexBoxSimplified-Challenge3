# Challenge File 3 from Flexbox Simplified

Another example challenge from Kevin Powell's class called Flexbox Simplified: 
https://www.kevinpowell.co/courses/

This challenge focuses on using the flex-basis property to lock in certain dimensions despite responsiveness. Flex basis is cool useful because it is dependent on the flex-direction and sizing will be responsive based on this direction.
